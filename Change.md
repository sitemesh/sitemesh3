## Core Enhancements
    -BaseSiteMeshContext.java: Added getContentProcessor() to expose the ContentProcessor.
    -TagBasedContentProcessor.java: Added getTagRuleBundles() to access the TagRuleBundle.

## Container-Specific Tweaks
    -ContainerTweaks.java: Introduced Tomcat11Tweaks with the following optimizations:
        +Avoid stream flushing to prevent early response commitment
        +Use safe header modification
        +Ignore IllegalStateException on error pages

## Response Commitment Prevention
    -HttpServletResponseBuffer.java: Numerous improvements to block early commitment:
        +Block flush() operations while buffering
        +Enhanced tracking of commitment status
        +Emergency flush mechanisms
        +Prevention of double-writes

## Enhanced Request Processing
    -ContentBufferingFilter.java: Complex logic for Tomcat 11 handling:
        +Disable JSP autoFlush
        +Wrap the response to block commitment
        +Emergency content writing with multiple fallback strategies
        +‚ÄúNuclear option‚Äù JavaScript injection as a last resort

## Smart Selector Logic
    -BasicSelector.java: Special handling of FORWARD dispatches to JSPs to ensure buffering

## Advanced Error Handling
    -SiteMeshFilter.java: A host of enhancements:
        +Emergency content writer
        +Response-unwrapping logic
        +Reflection-based forced writing for Tomcat 11
        +Multiple commitment checks

## üö® Problems Addressed by These Changes
    -Tomcat 11 tends to commit the response earlier than previous versions, which can cause SiteMesh to fail to apply decorators, resulting in:
        +Blank (white) pages
        +Undecorated content
        +IllegalStateException when writing after response has committed

## üîß Resolution Strategy
    -Prevention: Block early commitment via buffering and flush-blocking
    -Detection: Identify when the response has already committed
    -Recovery: Emergency content writing with multiple fallback mechanisms
    -Compatibility: Container-specific tweaks aimed at Tomcat 11
